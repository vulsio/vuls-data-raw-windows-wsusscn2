		"text": "This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow information disclosure if an attacker sends a specially crafted image URL in an Outlook Web Access (OWA) message that is loaded, without warning or filtering, from the attacker-controlled URL. Microsoft is issuing this security update for Oracle binaries to help ensure that all customers using this third-party code in Microsoft Exchange are protected from these vulnerabilities."
