An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code in the context of the Report Server service account.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker would need to submit a specially crafted page request to an affected Reporting Services instance.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services handles page requests."
